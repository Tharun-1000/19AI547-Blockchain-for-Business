# Experiment 6: Blockchain-Based Passwordless Authentication (Using Public-Private Key Cryptography)
# Aim:
To implement a secure passwordless authentication system using public-private key cryptography on Ethereum. This prevents phishing and password leaks.

# Algorithm:
step 1.The user registers by storing their Ethereum public key (address) in the contract.

step 2.During login, the server generates a random challenge message for the user to sign.

step 3.The user signs the challenge using their private key off-chain.

step 4.The signature (v, r, s) is submitted to the smart contract along with the original message hash.

step 5.The contract uses ecrecover to verify that the signerâ€™s address matches the registered user.

step 6.If verified, the user is authenticated securely without needing a password.

# Expected Output:
Users can register without a password.

# High-Level Overview:
Eliminates password hacks & phishing attacks.


Uses Ethereum's built-in cryptographic functions.


Inspired by Web3 login solutions like MetaMask authentication.

# RESULT: 

Hence we implemented code for Blockchain-Based Passwordless Authentication (Using Public-Private Key Cryptography)
