# Experiment 6: Blockchain-Based Passwordless Authentication (Using Public-Private Key Cryptography)
# Aim:
To implement a secure passwordless authentication system using public-private key cryptography on Ethereum. This prevents phishing and password leaks.

# Algorithm:
step 1.The user registers by storing their Ethereum public key (address) in the contract.

step 2.During login, the server generates a random challenge message for the user to sign.

step 3.The user signs the challenge using their private key off-chain.

step 4.The signature (v, r, s) is submitted to the smart contract along with the original message hash.

step 5.The contract uses ecrecover to verify that the signer’s address matches the registered user.

step 6.If verified, the user is authenticated securely without needing a password.

# Expected Output:
Users can register without a password.

# High-Level Overview:
Eliminates password hacks & phishing attacks.


Uses Ethereum's built-in cryptographic functions.


Inspired by Web3 login solutions like MetaMask authentication.

# RESULT: 

Hence we implemented code for Blockchain-Based Passwordless Authentication (Using Public-Private Key Cryptography)
